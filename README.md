Project Title: Exploring COVID-19 Outbreak Prediction with Python .

Description:
This project delves into the exploration of COVID-19 outbreak prediction using various machine learning  techniques implemented in Python. 

Key Objectives:

1.Data Acquisition and Preprocessing: Explore publicly available COVID-19 datasets  and clean, transform, and prepare the data for analysis.

2.Model Selection and Training: Implement and evaluate various machine learning models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM) suitable for time series forecasting, considering factors like case numbers, hospitalization rates, and vaccination data .

3.Visualization and Interpretation: Create informative visualizations to present predictions and highlight limitations of the models. Interpret the results with caution, emphasizing the uncertainty inherent in forecasting pandemics.
